## University of Illinois at Chicago East Campus MyTransitApp - CTA Version

Link to Active Site: https://ahmednkhan24.github.io/MyTransitApp-Web/index.html

This is the final project that I did during my time in the course IT202 during the Spring 2018 semester at UIC. 
This was an individual project and the subject of the project could be anything we wanted as long as it followed a certain criteria. 

The app that I chose to create for this project was a CTA Bus/Train tracker for UIC East Campus. The user is able to track any CTA bus that is on campus, and also the blue line trains that are on campus.

Another functionality is for the user to see a map of their location on campus and be able to see all of the bus stops or train stops that are near them.

Finally, in the settings screen the user is able to choose how much distance they want the map screen to showcase between their location and the different stops.
